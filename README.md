- Email : kumar.gaurav@softwaretesting4u.com

Welcome to my **Array DSA Practice** repository!  
This repo contains solutions to common and frequently asked array problems, written in **Java**, with clean and well-commented code.

These problems are part of my preparation for **SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)** interviews and focus on building a strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.


## ✅ Topics Covered

1. Find the **maximum and minimum** element in an array  
2. **Reverse** an array (without using built-in methods)  
3. Check if an array is **sorted** (ascending/descending)  
4. Print **duplicate** elements in an array  
5. **Remove duplicates** from an array  
6. **Sort** an array without using built-in sort method  
7. Find the **second largest** and **second smallest** element  
8. **Count occurrences** of each element  
9. **Merge two sorted** arrays into one sorted array  
10. Check if **two arrays are equal**
